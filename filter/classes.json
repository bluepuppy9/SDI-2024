Most students who enroll in the equivalent of this course in college are usually interested in further study of biology or medicine. There is less emphasis on breadth of content coverage and more emphasis on in-depth conceptual understanding and science practices. This course requires students to spend more time on inquiry based learning of concepts and development of scientific reasoning skills such as formulating a scientific argument, analyzing case studies, designing a plan for collecting data, analyzing data, applying statistical tests, and connecting concepts across disciplines. SITHS’s goal is to engage students in learning biology so that this course becomes a positive component of their high school experience, that not only prepares them for more advanced study in biology (if they choose to pursue that) but also enriches their life. Because we emphasize USING facts about biology rather than memorizing information, SITHS hopes the teaching methods used will significantly change the way students view the world. Sometimes students will practice applying the material alone, and sometimes students will do so with members of their learning team. SITHS wants to foster an interest in biology that continues beyond the date of the final exam, prepares students to make effective choices in the voting booth, enables students to be citizens of the world, and helps them acquire skills that can be used in other endeavors. The sequence of topics is as follows: scientific inquiry, ecology and plant biology, biochemistry, energy and cells, genetics, evolution, and human anatomy and physiology. At the end of the course, it is expected that the student takes and passes the respective Advanced Placement examination.",

First, students will investigate water use followed up with local water testing to explore the overall health of Staten Island’s waterways. Over the next few units, students will investigate the landscape and its biodiversity, discussing how biomes are changing and their impact on various species, including humans. This leads to an understanding of human population growth and its impacts on the environment, demonstrating the elasticity of the earth as well as its limitations. After identifying the consequences of our growth rate, students will determine our energy use and prioritize our energy resources in terms of economic and environmental factors. This segues into climate change – what it is, why it’s happening, its effects, and what we can do. The course will culminate in a final unit of sustainable cities, where students will discuss and create their own sustainable community based on the information gathered throughout the year.

The purpose of this course is for students to gain experience in the major investigative techniques currently used by forensic scientists, crime scene investigators, and other law enforcement agencies; and to develop an understanding of the scientific concepts that serve as the basis for these techniques. Students will also familiarize themselves with the law governing evidence collection, admissibility of scientific evidence in court, search and seizure, as well as relevant portions of the New York State Penal Law. Students will improve their skills in critical thinking, scientific writing, creative writing, laboratory skills, and verbal communication. This course will require students to spend more time on inquiry-based learning of concepts and development of scientific reasoning skills. Topics will include, but are not limited to the following: overview and history of forensic science, crime scene processing, evidence examination, physical matching, impression evidence, tool marks and firearms comparisons, fingerprint analysis, trace evidence and microscopy, questioned document analysis, arson investigation, death investigation, serology, bloodstain pattern analysis, and DNA testing.
